I have focuses on enhancing the design of the website by making targeted updates
to specific UI components. The original website was already near completion, so only a few
tweaks were introduced to improve the overall user interface. These updates aim to refine
the visual appeal and usability of the website without altering its core structure or functionality.
The changes are minimal yet impactful, ensuring a better user experience while maintaining
the integrity of the original design.
